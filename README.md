Weather ETL Analytics
ETL Process to fetch weather data, filter it based on conditions (e.g., rain, clouds), and store it in PostgreSQL for analytics.

Overview
This project is an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline that fetches weather data from the OpenWeather API, filters the data based on certain conditions (e.g., rainy or cloudy weather), and stores the cleaned data in a PostgreSQL database. The system is designed for easy scheduling and automation using Apache Airflow.
