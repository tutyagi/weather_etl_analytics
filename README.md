# Weather ETL Analytics

## Overview

**Weather ETL Analytics** is an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline that fetches weather data from the OpenWeather API, filters it based on conditions such as rain or clouds, and stores the filtered data into a PostgreSQL database for further analysis.

The project is designed to be extendable, with the goal of automating the ETL process using **Apache Airflow** for scheduling and orchestration.

## Key Features

- **Data Extraction**: Retrieves weather data from the OpenWeather API.
- **Data Filtering**: Filters weather data based on specific conditions such as rain or clouds and a temperature threshold of >20Â°C.
- **Data Loading**: Stores the filtered data in a PostgreSQL database.
- **Automation**: Uses Apache Airflow to automate the process, ensuring regular and consistent data updates.
